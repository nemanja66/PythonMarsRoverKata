You are given the initial starting point (0, 0, N) of a rover.
0,0 are the X, Y coordinates on a grid of (10,10).
'N' is the direction it is facing (i.e. N, S, E, W).
'L' and 'R' allow the rover to rotate left and right.
'M' allows the rover to move one point in the current direction.
The rover receives a character array of commands e.g. RMMLM and returns the finishing point after the move e.g. 2:1:N.
Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another (planets are spheres after all).
The grid may have obstacles. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, 
the rover moves up to the last possible point, aborts the sequence and reports the obstacle e.g (O:2:2:N).
